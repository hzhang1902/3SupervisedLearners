Decision Tree Scikit-learn

The input to your model will be an image, and the output will be a classification of the number, from 0- 9. You’ll get a chance to work with common machine learning packages used in modern research. In addition, you will practice using the numerical computation package Numpy for preprocessing.  

Report
• Model & Training Procedure Description For each classification algorithm, include sections describing the structure of your model. For example, for ANN include the number of layers, number of neurons in each layer, number of epochs used for training, and batch size used for training. 

• Graph Include a graph showing how training accuracy and validation accuracy change over time. Graph epochs versus training set and validation set accuracy. 

• Model Performance & Confusion Matrix For each algorithm, include a confusion matrix showing results of the model reported on the test set. The matrix should be a 10-by-10 grid showing which categories images were classified as. Use your confusion matrix to additionally report precision & recall for each of the 10 classes, as well as overall accuracy of your model. 

• Visualization For each algorithm, include 3 visualizations of images that were misclassified by your model and any observations about why you think these images were misclassified. You will have to create or use a visualization program that takes a 28-by-28 matrix input and translate it into a black-and-white image.

2. Description of Experiments
Baseline model: Training set accuracy: 1.000
				Testing set accuracy: 0.784

max_depth =  12: Training set accuracy: 0.982
				Validation set accuracy: 0.773
				Testing set accuracy: 0.781
		When set the depth equals 12, the validation set has the best accuracy

max_depth =  11: Training set accuracy: 0.967
				Validation set accuracy: 0.770
				Testing set accuracy: 0.784
max_depth =  10: Training set accuracy: 0.945
				Validation set accuracy: 0.762
				Testing set accuracy: 0.773

max_depth =  8: Training set accuracy: 0.861
				Testing set accuracy: 0.769

New discriminatory features: average intensity of pixels, 
							 average intensity of pixels of the left peice, after the image is splitted equally in two peices,
							 average intensity of pixels of the left up peice, after the image is splitted equally in four peices,
							 average intensity of pixels of the left up peice, after the image is splitted equally in eight peices,
